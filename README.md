This is a list of resources about programming practices for writing
safety-critical software.

**Disclaimer:** I don't work on safety-critical software so the resources
presented here are not necessarily authoritative documents on topic.

The starting point for me to create this resource was my interest in a solid
software:

[What kind of special training do engineers working on mission-critical software receive? [closed]](/blob/master/What_kind_of_special_training_do_engineer_working_on_mission-critical_software_receive?_-_Stack_Overflow.pdf) and [its followup on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/5iohue/what_kind_of_special_training_do_engineers/).

## Coding guidelines

- [MISRA guidelines](https://www.misra.org.uk/Publications/tabid/57/Default.aspx)

- [The Power of Ten – Rules for Developing Safety Critical Code](http://spinroot.com/gerard/pdf/P10.pdf)

> Jet Propulsion Laboratory – scientific institution making a lot of research and development for NASA. JPL have been developing software for most of unmanned missions in the field of deep space and other planets exploaration. Their portfolio includes such famous missons as Curiosity Mars rover and Voyager probe which left solar system after 25 years of flight and still providing scientific information. High level of automatization and long duration of missions led to superior demands to software quality. As a result of JPL amazing experience a set of code guidelines was developed and published recently.
